This is a shell with your PATH setup to work with XMDS. If you are new
to XMDS you probably want to have a look at the example scripts. They 
are located under

    $XMDS_SUPPORT/src/xmds2/examples

You can customise this bash shell by creating the file ~/.xmds/bash_profile
and adding any environment variables there.
